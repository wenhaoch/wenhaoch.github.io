			<li>I love cooking! The kitchen is a place where magic happens from experimentation.</li><br>
			<li>In my free time, I like to practise some calligraphy and handlettering - using fountain pens, brush pens, or using Adobe Procreate on a tablet.</li><br>
			<li>On days when the weather is great, I like to go out to take a walk and take some photos as well - either with a camera or just my phone.</li><br>
			<li>Swimming is my favourite form of exercise. Playing badminton is a close second.</li>
