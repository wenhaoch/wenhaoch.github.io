		<p><b>Economic Evaluation of the Different Undergraduate Housing Options</b><br>
		Project using engineering economy concepts of cash flow models as well as range sensitivity and risk analyses to evaluate uncertainty of different inputs. What-If and Options analyses to weigh the perspectives of different targets that would affect their financial decisions, and consideration of non-economic factors.</p><br>

		<p><b>Systems Dynamics Modelling of the Declining Elephant Population in Africa due to Poaching</b><br>
		Project using systems thinking and dynamics concept to model the problem and behaviour over time using causal loop diagrams and stock flow diagrams, while defining stakeholders and boundaries relevant to the problem. Conducted input verification, model testing and validation through various literature reviews to justify model. Sensitivity analysis of inputs to determine the most ideal and effective point of interception for policy making.</p><br>

		<p><b>Lunch Crowd Problem on Campus: Network Modelling of a Potential Food Delivery Service and Improved Scheduling of Cleaners</b><br>
		Project using operations research methods such as linear programming and network modelling to formulate mathematical problems representing the respective objectives and constraints.</p><br>

		<p><b>A Human Factors Approach to Redesigning In-Flight Safety Cards</b><br>
		Project focusing on the application of human factors engineering concepts to tackle the issue of flight passengers disregarding in-flight safety cards and demonstrations. From survey design and methodology to producing an alternate design of safety cards, the project seeked to tackle gaps in existing implemenations by understanding the cause of the problem and passenger mindset.</p><br>

		<p><b>Software Engineering Project</b><br>
		Project applying the principles of software engineering by modifying a given 10k LoC Java application (AddressBook) to a different product. Requirements, use cases, and documentation all recorded and updated along as the product was developed as a team iteratively using git workflow. The product of choice was a personal scheduler for a Personal Trainer.</p><br>

		<p><b>Evaluating the Efficiency of Different Supermarket Checkout Systems</b><br>
		Project applying different statistical and simulation concepts while modelling the different checkout systems in question using discrete event simulation. Input modelling to fit a distribution to the collected raw data for queueing times and service times, including bootstrapping where necessary, and performing statistical goodness-of-fit tests. Design and output analyses to estimate performance measures of system. Verification and validation of simulation model to compare behaviour with that of the real world, including using sensitivity analysis to change model parameters in accordance to varying real world characteristics.  </p><br>

		<p><b>BrushPaste: An Integrated Toothbrush and Toothpaste Holder to Reduce Waste</b><br>
		Project applying the different systems engineering and architecture fundamentals across an entire system development life cycle. Identifying existing operational deficiencies and technological opportunities and conducting needs analysis. Writing and documentation of operational and performance requirements of the desired product. Introducing candidate system concepts and evaluating trade-offs. Writing system functional and design specifications according to user requirements, including the use of Functional Flow Block Diagrams. Testing and evaluation plan for the 3-D printed prototype. Risk management for system development. </p><br>

		<p><b>Machine Learning and Trading</b><br>
		Project applying management engineering in finance. Using Python to prepare stock market data for use with technical indicators such as moving averages, relative strength index, and Bollinger bands. Implementing various trading strategies using different combinations of buy and sell signals to a portfolio and using random forest learners to choose the optimal trading strategy and predict future price changes.</p><br>
